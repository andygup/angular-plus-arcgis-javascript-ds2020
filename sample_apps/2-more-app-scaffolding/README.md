# More App Scaffolding

This sample builds on the basic app scaffolding demonstrated in sample 1.

In this sample we extend the map component with public properties and a simple event handler.

## Overview

- Quick start:

  ```bash
  # only once on your computer, no need to repeat if you already installed Angular
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

  ```bash
  # go to the second sample app
  cd ./sample_apps/2-app-scaffolding

  # install dependencies
  npm install

  # serve the app for development
  ng serve

  # or, if you want to build for production
  ng build --base-href ./
  ```

- Building blocks:

  - Angular CLI

  - "esri-loader"
  
  - Esri Typescript Types

  - custom demo files:

    - `esri-map.component.ts`

    - `esri-map.component.html`

    - `esri-map.component.css`
