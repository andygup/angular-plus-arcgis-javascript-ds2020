# App Scaffolding

This sample provides a boilerplate for standing up an Angular app that implements the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.  We leverage the Angular CLI and the [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader).

## Overview

- Quick start:

  ```bash
  # only once on your computer
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

  ```bash
  # go to the first sample app
  cd ./sample_apps/1-app-scaffolding

  # install dependencies
  npm install

  # serve the app for development
  ng serve

  # or, if you want to build for production
  ng build --base-href ./
  ```

- Building blocks:

  - Angular CLI

  - "esri-loader"

  - custom demo files:

    - `esri-map.component.ts`

    - `esri-map.component.html`

    - `esri-map.component.css`

## Background info on this sample code

This sample app was created following the instructions here: https://github.com/Esri/angular-cli-esri-map.

Please spend some time getting comfortable with those instructions.
